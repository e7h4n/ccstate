## Changelog & TODO

[Changelog](packages/rippling/CHANGELOG.md)

Here are some new ideas:

- Integration with svelte / solid.js
- Enhance devtools
  - Support viewing current subscription graph and related atom values
  - Enable logging and breakpoints for specific atoms in devtools
- Performance improvements
  - Mount atomState directly on atoms when there's only one store in the application to reduce WeakMap lookup overhead
  - Support static declaration of upstream dependencies for Computed to improve performance by disabling runtime dependency analysis
